# Introduction
The following project intends to provide a functional endpoint in which a potential user can visualize a map containing worldwide flight routes in real time. 

The need for such a project stems as a desire to function as a real-time alert system with which to calculate the range in which a solar flare can cause interference with the equipment on board of airships currently flying at high altitudes, given their vulnerability to EMP events.

As a final project, this aims to be a practical demostration of how a series of computers in parallel can be used to obtain an easily scalable product that could potentially be commercialized and expanded upon once completed, without relying on a single, high performance computer to perform the entire process.

# Objectives
The expected output of this project is a set of four servers, each of which provide an essential part of the project. Their denomination is as follows:

> Data Retrieval Server

In charge of obtaining real-time data from the OpenSky Network API, through the use of Python. Will relay said information in a timely manner to the Storage Server, while also keeping copies of recent data points as required for archive purposes.
As measured, the data retrieval process accounts for a 

> Storage Server

In charge of storing up-to-date data with PostgreSQL, to be sorted and retrieved as needed by the Processing Server.

> Processing Server

In charge of generating map images on demand, based on the request by the Web Server API

> Web Server

In charge of displaying map images to the end user through a modern web interface

# Toolset
The project is to be developed by making use of modern Python 3 libraries, including but not limited to:
* [The OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/) for data collection of near-real time flight information. 
* [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium), a wrapper to the [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) JavaScript mapping library. | v. 0.12.1
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) | v. 1.22.3
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) | v. 1.4.2

Additionally, it plans to make use of the following web technologies, on top of the usual development stack:
* [Apache HTTPD](https://httpd.apache.org/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
